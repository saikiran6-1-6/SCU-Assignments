# Student Marks Processing Program

## Summary

I developed a Java program to process student data from a CSV file, including names, IDs, and three assignment marks (0â€“30 each). 

It performs two tasks: filtering students with total marks below a user-specified threshold and displaying the top/bottom five students by total marks. 
Using OOP principles (Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction), it handles edge cases like missing/invalid marks and duplicate IDs with clear warnings. 
I compared two GenAI-generated solutions: an ArrayList-based solution (clear, robust, with detailed warnings) and a HashMap-based solution (concise, efficient sorting). 

I selected the ArrayList-based solution for its readability and educational alignment, enhancing my program with modular validation and improved error messages.
